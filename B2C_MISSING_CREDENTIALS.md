# 🔧 Worker Not Receiving Money/SMS - Missing B2C Setup

## ❌ **Issue:**
Worker not receiving:
- Money (B2C payout)
- SMS notification

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
B2C payouts require additional M-Pesa credentials that aren't configured.

## 🔧 **Missing Environment Variables:**

### **Add to Render:**
```
SECURITY_CREDENTIAL=your_b2c_security_credential
INITIATOR_NAME=testapi
B2C_SHORTCODE=600000
```

### **SMS Configuration:**
```
INFOBIP_API_KEY=your_infobip_key
INFOBIP_BASE_URL=https://api.infobip.com
```

## 🧪 **Test B2C Status:**
Check Render logs after payment for:
- "B2C Environment check"
- "B2C payout failed" errors

## ⚡ **Quick Fix - Disable B2C for Now:**
If you want tips to save without worker payouts, I can disable B2C temporarily.

## 📱 **Current Flow:**
1. ✅ Customer pays
2. ✅ Tip saved to database
3. ❌ B2C payout fails (missing credentials)
4. ❌ SMS fails (missing credentials)

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. Add B2C credentials to Render
2. Or disable B2C temporarily
3. Test payment flow

**B2C payouts need additional M-Pesa credentials to send money to workers!** 💰📱
