# 🎨 Payment Page Improvements - User-Friendly Experience

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **User-Friendly Messages**
- ❌ **Before**: "STK Push sent! Check your phone to complete payment"
- ✅ **After**: "📱 Check your phone and enter your M-Pesa PIN to complete the tip"

- ❌ **Before**: "Payment successful! Tip sent to Worker. Thank you!"
- ✅ **After**: "🎉 Thank you! Your tip has been sent to [Worker Name] successfully!"

- ❌ **Before**: "Duplicate transaction detected"
- ✅ **After**: "You just sent a tip! Please wait a moment before sending another."
