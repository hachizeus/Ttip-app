# 🔧 Callback Fallback - Added

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
Added fallback in M-Pesa callback to create tip record if it doesn't exist.

## 🔧 **How It Works:**
1. **Callback tries to update** existing tip record
2. **If record doesn't exist** → Creates new tip record with payment data
3. **Uses default worker** `VG001` for now
4. **Marks as completed** immediately

## 📱 **For Current Stuck Payment:**
**Manual Complete**: Visit this URL to complete the current payment:
```
https://ttip-app.onrender.com/api/complete-payment/ws_CO_310820250139471721475448
```

## 🧪 **Test New Payment:**
1. Make new payment
2. If initial save fails, callback will create the record
3. Payment should complete successfully
4. Check logs for "Tip record created successfully"

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. Complete current stuck payment manually
2. Test new payment flow
3. Fix root cause of initial save failure

**Callback now creates missing tip records as fallback!** 🔧📱💰
