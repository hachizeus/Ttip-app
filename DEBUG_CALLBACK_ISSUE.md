# 🔍 Debug Callback Issue

## ❌ **Problem:**
- Payment completed but web page still shows "Processing payment..."
- Worker didn't receive the 1 KSh
- M-Pesa callback not updating database

## 🔧 **Debug Steps Added:**

### 1. **Enhanced Callback Logging:**
- Added detailed M-Pesa callback logging
- Shows headers and full request body
- Check Render logs for callback data

### 2. **Manual Completion Endpoint:**
For testing, you can manually complete the payment:
```
POST https://ttip-backend.onrender.com/api/complete-payment/ws_CO_310820250029123721475448
```

### 3. **Payment Status Debugging:**
Check payment status:
```
GET https://ttip-backend.onrender.com/api/payment-status/ws_CO_310820250029123721475448
```

## 🧪 **Test Steps:**

### **After Backend Redeploys:**
1. **Check Render Logs** for M-Pesa callback data
2. **Test new payment** and watch logs
3. **If callback missing**, use manual completion endpoint
4. **Check database** for tip records

### **Manual Test:**
Visit: `https://ttip-backend.onrender.com/api/complete-payment/ws_CO_310820250029123721475448`

This will manually mark the payment as completed and update worker stats.

**Enhanced debugging will show if M-Pesa callbacks are being received!** 🔍📱
