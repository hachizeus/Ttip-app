# 🔧 Daraja Environment Variables - FIXED!

## ❌ **Issue Found:**
The `enhanced-daraja.mjs` file was trying to load `.env` file which doesn't exist on Render, causing it to use undefined credentials.

## ✅ **Fixed:**
- Removed `.env` file dependency
- Environment variables now loaded directly from Render
- Added logging to verify credentials in daraja module

## 🔄 **Render Status:**
- Backend is redeploying with the fix
- Wait for "Deploy successful" message

## 🧪 **Test After Deploy:**
1. Visit: https://ttip-backend.onrender.com/tip/W12345678
2. Enter amount: 1
3. Enter phone: 0721475448
4. Click "Send STK Push"
5. Check Render logs for "Daraja env check" message

## 📱 **Expected Result:**
- Logs show: `hasConsumerKey: true, consumerKeyPreview: "Z4i4VgqbkU..."`
- STK push should work successfully
- No more "Wrong credentials" error

**The root cause was environment variable loading - now fixed!** 🔧📱
