# Notification Fix Summary

## Issue
Workers were not receiving notifications in the home screen when they received tips.

## Root Cause
The M-Pesa callback handler was not calling the notification service to create notifications when tips were successfully processed.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Notification Call to Callback Handler
**File**: `backend/server.js`
- Added import and call to `notifyTipReceived()` function in the M-Pesa callback handler
- This ensures notifications are created when tips are successfully processed

### 2. Fixed Database Column Mismatch
**File**: `backend/notifications-service.js`
- Changed `body` field to `message` field to match mobile app expectations
- Changed `status: 'UNREAD'` to `status: 'unread'` for consistency
- Changed `meta` field to `data` field to match mobile app schema

### 3. Improved Notification Content
**File**: `backend/notifications-service.js`
- Added total_tips to notification data for better context
- Improved logging for debugging

## How It Works Now

1. **Customer sends tip** → STK Push initiated
2. **M-Pesa processes payment** → Callback received
3. **Callback handler**:
   - Updates transaction status to COMPLETED
   - Updates worker stats (total_tips, tip_count)
   - **NEW**: Calls `notifyTipReceived()` function
4. **Notification service**:
   - Creates notification in database
   - Checks for milestone achievements
   - Sends SMS notification (if configured)
5. **Mobile app**:
   - Real-time subscription detects new notification
   - Updates notification count in home screen
   - Shows notification in notifications screen

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Send a tip to a worker using the payment page
2. Complete the M-Pesa payment
3. Check the worker's mobile app home screen for notification badge
4. Check the notifications screen for the tip notification

## Files Modified
1. `backend/server.js` - Added notification call to callback handler
2. `backend/notifications-service.js` - Fixed database column names and improved logging

## Expected Behavior
- Workers should now see notification badges on home screen when they receive tips
- Notifications should appear in the notifications screen with proper formatting
- Milestone notifications should also work for achievement thresholds
