-- BULLETPROOF DATABASE FIX FOR TTIP
-- Handles view dependencies and adds missing RLS policies

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. DROP DEPENDENT VIEWS FIRST
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop views that depend on worker_id column
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS worker_analytics CASCADE;

-- ============================================================================
-- 2. FIX DATA TYPE MISMATCHES (NOW SAFE)
-- ============================================================================

-- Now we can safely alter the column type
ALTER TABLE transactions 
ALTER COLUMN worker_id TYPE character varying;

-- Add foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE transactions 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS transactions_worker_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE transactions 
ADD CONSTRAINT transactions_worker_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (worker_id) REFERENCES workers(worker_id);

-- ============================================================================
-- 3. CREATE TRIGGER FUNCTION TO UPDATE WORKER STATISTICS
-- ============================================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_worker_stats()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$

    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT' OR TG_OP = 'UPDATE') AND NEW.mpesa_tx_id IS NOT NULL AND NEW.worker_id IS NOT NULL THEN
