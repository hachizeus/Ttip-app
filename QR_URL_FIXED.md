# 📱 QR Code URL Format - FIXED

## ❌ **Previous Issue:**
- QR code contained only worker ID (e.g., "W12345678")
- Google camera scanner showed "search bar code"
- No meaningful action for external scanners

## ✅ **Fixed QR Code:**
- Now contains proper URL: `https://ttip-app.vercel.app/tip/W12345678`
- Google camera scanner shows "Open in browser"
- Works both in-app and externally

## 🔄 **Scanner Updated:**
- Handles both URL format and worker ID format
- Extracts worker ID from URL: `/tip/W12345678`
- Maintains backward compatibility

## 📱 **Now Works With:**
- ✅ TTip app scanner (in-app)
- ✅ Google camera scanner (external)
- ✅ Any QR scanner app
- ✅ iPhone camera scanner

## 🌐 **External Scanning:**
When scanned with Google camera:
1. Shows "Open ttip-app.vercel.app"
2. Opens web version of tip page
3. Can redirect to app if installed

**QR codes now work universally with any scanner!** 🎉📱
