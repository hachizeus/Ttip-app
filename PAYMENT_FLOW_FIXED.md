# ðŸ”§ Payment Flow - FIXED!

## âœ… **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Database Saving:**
- Tips now saved to database with 'pending' status initially
- Only updated to 'completed' when M-Pesa callback confirms payment
- Worker statistics updated only on successful payment

### 2. **Worker Payout:**
- B2C payout enabled - worker receives money automatically
- SMS notification sent to worker on successful tip
- Proper error handling for B2C failures

### 3. **Web Loading State:**
- Shows "Processing payment..." after STK push sent
- Checks payment status every 5 seconds
- Shows success/failure message when payment completes
- Auto-stops checking after 2 minutes

### 4. **Callback URL:**
- Fixed to use backend callback: `https://ttip-backend.onrender.com/api/callback`
- Proper M-Pesa callback handling for payment confirmation
