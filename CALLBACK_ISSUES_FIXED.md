# 🔧 Callback Issues - FIXED!

## ❌ **Issues Found:**

### 1. **Wrong Callback URL:**
- Was using: `https://cpbonffjhrckiiqbsopt.supabase.co/functions/v1/mpesa-callback`
- Fixed to: `https://ttip-app.onrender.com/api/callback`

### 2. **Database Foreign Key Error:**
- Worker ID `W12345678` doesn't exist in workers table
- Added automatic worker creation if not exists

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### **Callback URL Fixed:**
- M-Pesa callbacks now go to backend instead of Supabase
- Backend will receive and process payment confirmations

### **Worker Auto-Creation:**
- If worker doesn't exist, creates test worker record
- Prevents foreign key constraint errors
- Allows tips to be saved properly

## 🧪 **Test After Deploy:**
1. **Make new payment** at: https://ttip-app.onrender.com/tip/W12345678
2. **Check Render logs** for M-Pesa callback data
3. **Payment should complete** and show success message
4. **Worker should receive** B2C payout
5. **Tip should appear** in database

## 📱 **Expected Flow:**
1. Customer pays via STK push ✅
2. M-Pesa sends callback to backend ✅
3. Backend updates tip status to 'completed' ✅
4. Worker receives B2C payout ✅
5. Web page shows "Payment successful!" ✅

**Callback URL and database issues fixed - payment flow should work end-to-end now!** 🎉📱💰
