# 🔧 B2C Payout Debugging - Added

## ❌ **Issue:**
Worker not receiving money after successful payment

## ✅ **Debugging Added:**
- Detailed B2C logging
- Environment variable checks
- Payload and response logging
- Error handling improvements

## 🔧 **Missing Environment Variables:**
Add these to Render for B2C payouts to work:

### **Required B2C Variables:**
```
SECURITY_CREDENTIAL=your_security_credential
INITIATOR_NAME=testapi
B2C_SHORTCODE=600000
```

### **Optional (will use defaults):**
```
B2C_TIMEOUT_URL=https://ttip-backend.onrender.com/api/b2c-timeout
B2C_RESULT_URL=https://ttip-backend.onrender.com/api/b2c-callback
```

## 🧪 **Test After Adding Variables:**
1. Add missing environment variables to Render
2. Make a test payment
3. Check Render logs for:
   - "B2C Payment Request Start"
   - "B2C Environment check"
   - "B2C Response"

## 📋 **Expected B2C Flow:**
1. Customer pays → STK callback received
2. Tip saved to database
3. B2C payout initiated to worker
4. Worker receives money
5. B2C callback confirms payout

## 🎯 **Most Likely Issue:**
Missing `SECURITY_CREDENTIAL` environment variable - this is required for B2C payments.

**Add the missing B2C environment variables to enable worker payouts!** 🔧📱💰
